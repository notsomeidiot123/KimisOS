1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just be respectful.

   Not being respectful includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY disrespectful.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That's EXTREMELY disrespectful.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a disrespectful person would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and complaining when it goes wrong makes
you a very mean person. Fix the problem yourself. A respectful person would submit the fix back.

This license may be subject to change, and will apply to versions of the code written up to and until the license has changed, including versions written before this license was implemented.
